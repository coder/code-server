# Welcome to headscale

## Design goal

Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) control server. Headscale's goal is to
provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for
their projects and labs. It implements a narrow scope, a _single_ Tailscale
network (tailnet), suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source
organisation.
