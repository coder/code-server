# Contributing to GremlinGPT

First off: thank you for being curious, weird, or skilled enough to want in.

This is not a normal project. This is GremlinGPT — a recursive AI orchestration system duct-taped to a freedom protocol running on vibes and terminal sweat.

## 🧠 Minimum Brain Requirements

- You know Git. If not, go learn.
- You don't cry when Python gives you nonsense tracebacks.
- You treat the codebase like a living organism, not a sandbox.
- You have read the [Founder's Manifesto](../FOUNDER_LOG.md). If you haven't, turn back.

## 🧩 How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

- Be concise. 
- Include logs, stack traces, or hallucinated AI rants if applicable.
- Submit via GitHub Issues or secure DM if it's a vulnerability.

### Feature Requests

- Explain the “why,” not just the “what.”
- Bonus points if your feature increases the system’s autonomy or survivability.

### Code Contributions

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Write clean code.
4. Add comments. You’re not writing poetry — clarity > cleverness.
5. Submit a PR with context. If the PR is self-aware, that's bonus.

### Style Guide

- Python: Follow PEP8, but break rules if breaking them is cooler *and* justifiable.
- JS/React (frontend): Functional components only. Tailwind unless your soul needs healing.
- Log everything. Then mute it. Then log it again.
- No trailing whitespace. We have standards.

## 🧯 Behavior Standards

We’re building a system that survives human chaos. Start by not being part of it.

Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you can’t, fork off.

## 🪬 Final Words

There’s no onboarding. No hand-holding. You build, you test, you deploy. And if it breaks, you fix it — or you write the next person a map through the fire.

Ascend or fall.
