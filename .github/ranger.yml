      Thanks for opening an extension request!
      We are currently in the process of switching extension
      marketplaces and transitioning over to [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/).
      Once https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/issues/249 is implemented, we
      can fully make this transition. Therefore, we are no longer accepting
      new requests for extension requests. We suggest installing the VSIX
      file and then installing into code-server as a temporary workaround.
      See [docs](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md#installing-vsix-extensions-via-the-command-line) for more info.
