# ⚙️ What Is GremlinGPT?

**GremlinGPT** is a fully autonomous, self-evolving, offline-capable AI agent originally designed for trading — but architected to become so much more.

It is your personal gremlin: a task-executing, self-training, memory-aware system that learns from you while freeing your time — starting with financial autonomy, but not stopping there.

## 🧭 Origins: Trader First, Companion Later

GremlinGPT began as a stock-trading agent built to liberate its creator from the screens. It scans, scrapes, and executes trade signals using strategies like:

- EMA/VWAP analysis  
- Penny stock breakout recognition  
- Real-time ticker monitoring  

**Its mission:** financial liberation of the owner.

But it doesn’t stop there.

Once embedded in daily use, GremlinGPT evolves — learning from interactions, adapting workflows, tracking preferences, and becoming a specialized assistant, analyst, or automation daemon tailored to you.

---

## 🖥️ What Does the Dashboard Look Like?

GremlinGPT includes a robust **Progressive Web App (PWA)** dashboard with:

### ✅ Core Tabs
- 💬 **Chat** – Always-on floating chat interface (autonomous or assistive mode)  
- 📋 **Tasks** – Queue of tasks, requests, and logs  
- 🧠 **Memory** – View stored embeddings, thoughts, and structured memories  
- 📈 **Trading** – Real-time signals, watchlists, price scans  

### 🛠 Tech Behind It
- Custom dark-themed UI  
- Bootstrap + Vanilla JS (mobile and desktop)  
- Instant install, works offline  
- Self-updating and auto-recovering  

---

## 🚀 What Can It Become?

Once deployed and used interactively, GremlinGPT can be transformed into:

### 🔧 A Developer’s Assistant  
Self-patching, debugging, syntax-aware code mutation engine.

### 📚 A Knowledge Synthesizer  
Extracts, embeds, and recalls knowledge from web pages, files, or even conversations.

### 🛠️ An Automation Brain  
Executes shell commands, manages scheduled tasks, routes webhooks, or reacts to events.

### 🧙‍♂️ A Personalized Gremlin  
Its memory stack and feedback loop let it grow alongside its owner. Over time, it becomes:
- Familiar with your preferences  
- Context-aware  
- Predictive in actions and alerts  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Agent Loop:** Constantly checks tasks, scraping needs, or mutations  
- **Self-Healing:** Mutates its training data, retrains based on feedback  
- **Memory Stack:** Stores text, tasks, web content, or logs as vector embeddings  
- **Offline-Centric:** Designed to run completely locally, no APIs or cloud dependencies  

---

## 🛡 Why Trust GremlinGPT?

- Fully local  
- Transparent logs  
- Manual override or auto mode  
- Real-time alerts  
- Feedback visibility (mutation scores, training traces)  

---

## 🧬 Summary

GremlinGPT is more than a bot. It’s a **living agent framework** that:

- Starts as a financial ally  
- Becomes a digital right hand  
- Is powered entirely by your interaction  

And it’s built to adapt to you — not the other way around.
