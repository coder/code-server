Hi there! 👋

Thanks for reporting a bug.

Please search for existing issues before filing, as they may contain additional
information about the problem and descriptions of workarounds. Provide as much
information as you can, so that we can reproduce the issue. Otherwise, we may
not be able to help diagnose the problem, and may close the issue as
unreproducible or incomplete. For visual defects, please include screenshots to
help us understand the issue.

## Expected

<!-- What should happen? -->

## Actual

<!-- What actually happens? -->

## Logs

<!--
First run code-server with at least debug logging (or trace to be really
thorough) by setting the --log flag or the LOG_LEVEL environment variable. -vvv
and --verbose are aliases for --log trace. For example:

code-server --log debug

Once this is done, replicate the issue you're having then collect logging
information from the following places:

    1. The most recent files from ~/.local/share/code-server/coder-logs.
    2. The browser console.
    3. The browser network tab.

Additionally, collecting core dumps (you may need to enable them first) if
code-server crashes can be helpful.

## Notes

<!-- If you can reproduce the issue on vanilla VS Code,
please file the issue at the VS Code repository instead. -->
