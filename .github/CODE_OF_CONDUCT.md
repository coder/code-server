# 🧠 Contributor Covenant // AscendNet Edition

## v.1.0. // "We Build. We Don’t Harass."

### Our Pledge
We, the maladjusted minds behind AscendNet, pledge to build this AI-obsessed, code-mutating experiment in a way that’s free from harassment, dogma, and drama. Regardless of whether you’re bootstrapping from a microwave or pushing PRs from a 96-core bunker, you’re welcome here.

We pledge to interact like semi-functional humans, or at least like socially aware cyborgs. This means no harassment, no discrimination, and no being a jerk.

### Our Standards
Want to contribute? Great. Here’s the vibe:

## Expected behavior:

Treat others like they're debugging code with a migraine. Go easy.

Respect different views — even the totally wrong ones.

Give feedback like you’re not trying to start a war.

Take responsibility when you break things. Apologize. Learn. Update your worldview.

Remember the mission: Build smart systems. Don’t act like a broken one.

## Unacceptable behavior:

Creepy comments. Crude memes. Sexualized anything. Gross.

Trolling. Flame wars. “Git blame” culture.

Harassment, public or private.

Doxxing or leaking info without consent.

Turning this into some ideological battleground. Take that to Reddit.

Enforcement Responsibilities
Admins (read: tired but firm code wizards) have the final say. If you're acting like a corrupted node, they’ll snip your connection and sanitize the logs. They reserve the right to:

Remove or modify any content.

Nuke your access if needed.

Deliver ban-hammer justice — gently or violently, depending on vibes.

## Scope
This code applies in all spaces: commits, issues, PRs, Discord, signal fires, dead drops — wherever AscendNet exists. If you represent the project publicly, the rules follow you like a tracking cookie.

## Enforcement Contact
Got a problem? We’re here:

📱 Text: +1 (785) 443-6288

📧 Email: Ascend.Gremlin@gmail.com

We’ll respond with fairness, confidentiality, and just enough caffeine to stay civil.

Enforcement Guidelines
Depending on your level of tomfoolery:

1. ✉️ Correction
Impact: Minor screw-up, unintentional.

Consequence: Private warning. Maybe a meme about your behavior. Fix it and move on.

2. ⚠️ Warning
Impact: A real violation, maybe with receipts.

Consequence: Public warning. Time-out mode. Don’t poke the mods. Stay off the radar.

3. 🚫 Temp Ban
Impact: You blew it.

Consequence: You’re out for a bit. Go touch grass, rebase your behavior.

4. 🧨 Permaban
Impact: Consistently toxic. A walking StackOverflow meltdown.

Consequence: Goodbye forever. Your access is revoked, and the logs are scrubbed.

### Attribution
Based on the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0 — lovingly rewritten by weirdos who talk to AI more than people.
