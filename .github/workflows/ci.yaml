  # NOTE@oxy:
  # We use Ubuntu 16.04 here, so that our build is more compatible
  # with older libc versions. We used to (Q1'20) use CentOS 7 here,
  # but it has a full update EOL of Q4'20 and a 'critical security'
  # update EOL of 2024. We're dropping full support a few years before
  # the final EOL, but I don't believe CentOS 7 has a large arm64 userbase.
  # It is not feasible to cross-compile with CentOS.

  # Cross-compile notes: To compile native dependencies for arm64,
  # we install the aarch64/armv7l cross toolchain and then set it as the default
  # compiler/linker/etc. with the AR/CC/CXX/LINK environment variables.
  # qemu-user-static on ubuntu-16.04 currently doesn't run Node correctly,
  # so we just build with "native"/x86_64 node, then download arm64/armv7l node
  # and then put it in our release. We can't smoke test the cross build this way,
  # but this means we don't need to maintain a self-hosted runner!

  # NOTE@jsjoeio:
  # We used to use 16.04 until GitHub deprecated it on September 20, 2021
